# Intelligent-Timetable-Scheduler-
A smart university timetable scheduling system using AI techniques like CSP to automatically generate conflict-free and optimized timetables.
# 🧠 Intelligent Timetable Scheduler for University (CSP + GUI)

This project is an AI-powered **Intelligent Timetable Scheduler** that uses **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)** logic to generate valid, conflict-free university timetables. A user-friendly **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** built with `Tkinter` allows for interactive data input and automatic timetable generation.
